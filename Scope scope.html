    /*
        I can write a whole article about this weird situation
        but long story short, this is becasue the setTimeout()
        is an asynchronous function.
        As we know javascript is a single threaded language that
        can not be blocked. which means when we get an async code 
        the "event loop" will assign that code to the web api which
        will process it then get it back into the stack and that result
        will wait in the stack for it's turn.
        so here when we run that code the for loop starts with 1
        then it find the setTimeout() which will be handed to the web api
        when we get the result of it after 1 second it will be too late and 
        the for loop will be finished and the i variable not is 6.
        then it will console.log(i) which is 6, 5 times.  
    */
        for (var i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
            setTimeout(function () {
                console.log(i);
            }, 1000);
        } 
    </script>
